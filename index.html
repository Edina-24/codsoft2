            <h1>About Me</h1>
            
            <p>Hi, I'm Edina, a B.Tech IT student, passionate about technology and its endless possibilities. Currently pursuing my degree at St.Joseph's College Of Engineering.</p>
            <p>
                During my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to work on exciting projects, such as developing web applications, participating in hackathons, and contributing to open-source initiatives. These experiences have honed my skills in JavaScript, Python, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I'm a volunteer at Teach For India, and a lifelong learner. My goal is to leverage my IT knowledge to make a positive impact in the tech industry and continue learning, growing, and collaborating with like-minded individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edina-devapitchai-644b10259/">LinkedIn</a> to explore my work. I'm always open to exciting opportunities and discussions, so don't hesitate to get in touch.
